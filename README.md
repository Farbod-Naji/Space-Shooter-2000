# Space Shooter 2000
 
Space Shooter 2000 is a small game made as a project for the Ubisoft NEXT Competition 2020. In the competition we were given 3 day to build an adaptation of the game “Tempest”. This program is written in C++, developed with the API provided by Ubisoft for this competition. All the code writen by me in this project are in "Farbod's Code" files and "GameTest.cpp".
